This is a Faux-Blog-Application or notepad app that I built entirely with express. This app was my first real project using express. I enjoyed learning the syntax and found it rather rewarding. I built this project before I learned any React and was running local servers off of just node/nodemon. The syntax later reminded me of props which is much easier to work with but express is still pretty cool. The <% %> syntax remids me of string literals which is pretty cool.
